# Expo CLI: Obscure "Unexpected error during initialization"

This repository demonstrates a common yet difficult-to-diagnose error in Expo CLI:  "Unexpected error during initialization". The error message is vague, often stemming from version mismatches between the Expo CLI, SDK version, and potentially corrupted project files. 

## Problem

The problem is that the Expo CLI initialization fails without providing clear guidance on the root cause. This makes debugging challenging for developers.

## Solution

The solution involves verifying and updating the following:

1. **Expo CLI Version:** Ensure you have the latest Expo CLI installed (`npm install -g expo-cli` or `yarn global add expo-cli`).
2. **SDK Version:** Check the `sdkVersion` in your `app.json` file. Make sure it aligns with the supported SDK versions for your Expo CLI version. Refer to the Expo documentation for compatibility information.
3. **Package.json:** Verify all dependencies are correctly installed and have compatible versions. Resolve any conflicting dependencies.
4. **Cache Cleanup:** In some cases, a corrupted Expo cache might cause issues. Try `expo start --clear` to clear the cache.
5. **Project Re-creation (Last Resort):** If all else fails, create a new Expo project and carefully transfer relevant files, settings, and code to avoid any lingering inconsistencies from the original project.
