The solution involves a multi-pronged approach to systematically identify and resolve the root cause of the "Unexpected error during initialization" within an Expo project.

1. **Verify Expo CLI Version:**
   ```bash
   expo -v
   ```
   Update if necessary using `npm install -g expo-cli` or `yarn global add expo-cli`.

2. **Check and Update SDK Version in app.json:**
   Ensure the `sdkVersion` in your `app.json` is compatible with your Expo CLI version.  Check the Expo documentation for supported SDK versions.

3. **Review and Update package.json:**
   Carefully review your `package.json` to ensure all dependencies have compatible versions. Resolve any version conflicts using tools like `npm-check-updates` or `yarn why`.

4. **Clear the Expo Cache:**
   Try running `expo start --clear` to clear any potentially corrupted cache data. 

5. **Create a New Project (If Necessary):**
   If the previous steps fail, recreate your Expo project.  Carefully transfer code and assets to minimize errors.

Example of an `app.json` file with a potentially incompatible `sdkVersion`:
```json
{
  "expo": {
    "name": "My App",
    "sdkVersion": "45.0.0" // This might be incompatible with a newer Expo CLI 
  }
}
```

By systematically addressing these points, developers can effectively resolve the cryptic "Unexpected error during initialization" and get their Expo projects running smoothly.
